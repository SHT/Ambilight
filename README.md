# Ambilight

This project aims to deliver a robust client-server command-line application that is able to stream live, low-latency LED color data to a controller via a wireless / wired network connection.

## WIP

The project is currently under development. There might be bugs or inaccuracies on some parts of the documentation.

**TODO:**
- [ ] Build instructions
- [ ] Add dependencies on README
- [x] Setup instructions
- [x] Include more modes (Rainbow, Pulse etc.)
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Contributing instructions
- [x] Add binaries for Windows / Linux



## How it works

The *client* is launched on a Windows / Mac / Linux PC and the *server* on a controller (e.g. Raspberry Pi) that is wired with the LED strip that will be controlled.

Once the server is running on the controller, whenever the client is launched it will try to connect with the command-line parameters provided.

When the connection is established, the client will stream data to the server via a TCP socket, and the server will act according to the specified mode of operation (for now only Ambilight and Rainbow modes are supported, more will be added soon)

*Whatever dude how do I install it?*

## Installation instructions
- **Client** (e.g. Windows PC):
  1. Download the *client* binary for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/SHT/Core/releases/latest/).
  2. Create a `run.bat` file on the same folder as the binary.
  3. Paste the following on the `run.bat` file,
    ```
    ambilight-client-windows-x64.exe IP PORT LEDS_COUNT FRAMERATE
    ```
  replacing `IP`, `PORT`, `LEDS_COUNT` and `FRAMERATE` accordingly.
  4. Double click the `run.bat` file to launch the client. It will autoconnect to the server once the server is online.


- **Server** (e.g. Raspberry Pi Zero W):
  1. Download the *server* binary for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/SHT/Core/releases/latest/).
  2. Install `tmux` using the following command:

    `sudo apt-get install tmux`

  3. Create a `run.sh` file on the same folder as the binary. Make sure the file is marked as executable:

    `chmod +x server`

  4. Paste the following on the `run.sh` file,
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    tmux new-session -d -s ambilight 'cd /AMBILIGHT_FOLDER && ./server LEDS_COUNT BRIGHTNESS PIN PORT'
    ```
    replacing `AMBILIGHT_FOLDER`, `LEDS_COUNT`, `BRIGHTNESS`, `PIN` and `PORT` accordingly.  
    The arguments `PIN` and `PORT` are optional and default to `18` and `4197` respectively.
  5. (optional) Start the server at boot:
    - Edit the `/etc/rc.local` file, adding the following before the `exit 0` line,
      ```
      /AMBILIGHT_FOLDER/run.sh
      ```
      replacing `AMBILIGHT_FOLDER` with the folder where the ambilight server binary resides.
  6. Execute the run.sh file to start the Ambilight server (or reboot if you configured start at boot):

    `./run.sh`

## Modes

```txt
A : Ambilight : Renders the streaming LED data that are provided from the client.
R : Rainbow   : Infinite loop of a gradient color shift animation.
```

## Under the hood

This library consists of 3 packages, a client (client.go), a server (server.go), and a wrapper package (ambilight.go) that has functions that the client and server use to connect to one another and transmit/receive data.
There are verbose comments and documentation throughout these packages, detailing how everything is set up.

When the socket connection is established, the client sends a TCP packet with this format:


```
Bytes (binary):

  - 1: MMMM MMMM * M is mode ascii character
  - 2: RRRR RRRR * R is red
  - 3: GGGG GGGG * G is green
  - 4: BBBB BBBB * B is blue
  - 5: RRRR RRRR * repeats for each additional LED
  - 6: GGGG GGGG
  - 7: BBBB BBBB
       ..
```

The first byte is the ASCII **mode** character in binary.  
The rest of the bytes that follow MUST be `N * 3`, where `N` is the number of LEDs that will be controlled.  
If the strip has more leds the rest of the LEDs' behavior is undefined, if it has less the underlying ws2811.c library will probably error out (haven't tested that out, YMMV)
