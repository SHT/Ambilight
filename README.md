# Ambilight

This project aims to deliver a robust client-server command-line application that is able to stream live, low-latency LED color data to a controller via a wireless / wired network connection.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries:
 - [cretz](https://github.com/cretz) / [go-scrap](https://github.com/cretz/go-scrap) - A wrapper around the Rust [scrap](https://github.com/quadrupleslap/scrap) library, which enables capturing the contents of the screen.
 - [gadgetoid, supcik, urmel11](https://github.com/orgs/rpi-ws281x/people) / [rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/rpi-ws281x/rpi-ws281x-go) - Raspberry Pi library for controlling WS281X LEDs
 - [getlantern](https://github.com/getlantern) / [systray](github.com/getlantern/systray) - A library providing an easy API to add tray functionality
 -

## WIP

The project is currently under development. There might be bugs or inaccuracies on some parts of the documentation.

**TODO:**
- [ ] Build instructions
- [x] Add dependencies on README
- [x] Setup instructions
- [x] Include more modes (Rainbow, Pulse etc.)
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Contributing instructions
- [x] Add binaries for Windows / Linux



## How it works

The *client* is launched on a Windows / Mac / Linux PC and the *server* on a controller (e.g. Raspberry Pi) that is wired with the LED strip that will be controlled.

Once the server is running on the controller, whenever the client is launched it will try to connect with the command-line parameters provided.

When the connection is established, the client will stream data to the server via a TCP socket, and the server will act according to the specified mode of operation (for now only Ambilight and Rainbow modes are supported, more will be added soon)

*Whatever dude how do I install it?*

## Installation instructions

#### Client (e.g. Windows PC)

1. Download the *client* binary for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/SHT/Ambilight/releases/latest/). Place anywhere you want. Launch the executable. Right click on the tray icon and quit.

2. The default `ambilight.conf` file was just created.

3. Edit the file to match your setup. **NOTE:** `leds_count` should be the sum of the displays' leds.

4. Launch the client again. It will automatically connect to the server once the server is online.



#### Server (e.g. Raspberry Pi Zero W)

0. Prerequisite: Have SSH enabled and be connected to a wifi network.  
For setup information look here: [Headless Pi Zero W Wifi Setup (Windows)](https://desertbot.io/blog/headless-pi-zero-w-wifi-setup-windows)

1. Login to the raspberry via SSH.

1. Install `tmux` using the following command:

  `sudo apt-get install tmux -y`

3. Download the server binary (for example using `wget`):

  `wget https://github.com/SHT/Ambilight/releases/download/0.0.1-pre-release/ambilight-server`

4. Mark the binary as executable:

  `sudo chmod +x ambilight-server`

5. Start the server once, the configuration file will be created automatically. Now close the server (`Ctrl+C`).
6. Edit the configuration file (`ambilight.conf`) to match the one you setup earlier for the client. The two configuration files *must* be the same. You can use `nano` for this (`sudo nano ambilight.conf`).

7. To start the server, simply write `sudo ./ambilight-server` on the terminal.

8. *(optional)* Start the server at boot:  
Edit the `/etc/rc.local` file (`sudo nano /etc/rc.local`), adding the following before the `exit 0` line, replacing `AMBILIGHT_FOLDER` with the folder where the ambilight server binary resides.

  `tmux new-session -d -s ambilight 'cd /AMBILIGHT_FOLDER && sudo ./ambilight-server'`

  If you reboot the server will start automatically.

## Modes

```txt
A : Ambilight : Renders the streaming LED data that are provided from the client.
R : Rainbow   : Infinite loop of a gradient color shift animation.
```

## Under the hood

This library consists of 3 packages, a client (client.go), a server (server.go), and a utilities package (ambilight.go) that has functions that the client and server use to connect to one another and transmit/receive data, along with maintaining the state of the Ambilight service.

Once the client is online, it indefinitely attempts to connect to the server. When the server comes online, a TCP connection is established and the client starts capturing the screen and transmitting the LED color data to the server, using the *Ambilight* operation mode.

In this mode, the client is taking "screenshots", reading the border pixels, averaging them depending on the LEDs count, and sending the data to the server. The underlying [scrap](https://github.com/quadrupleslap/scrap) library captures raw pixel data from the client GPU's Backbuffer, which is a really more performant method than alternatives ([BitBlt](https://github.com/kbinani/screenshot), for example). There is no noticeable performance drop while the Ambilight mode is engaged.

When the socket connection is established, the client sends a message with this format:


```
Bytes (binary):

  - 1: MMMM MMMM * M is the mode character encoded in ascii
  - 2: RRRR RRRR * R is red
  - 3: GGGG GGGG * G is green
  - 4: BBBB BBBB * B is blue
  - 5: RRRR RRRR * repeats for each additional LED
  - 6: GGGG GGGG
  - 7: BBBB BBBB
       ..
```

The first byte is the ASCII *mode* character.  
The rest of the bytes that follow MUST be `N * 3`, where `N` is the number of LEDs that will be controlled.  
If the strip has more or less LEDs the behavior is undefined.

The Rainbow mode is basically a moving color wheel gradient, meaning that all the LEDs have the next color in the chain, and they cycle all the available colors, from red to green to blue and back to red. It is implemented server-side, so no data needs to be sent after initiating it.
